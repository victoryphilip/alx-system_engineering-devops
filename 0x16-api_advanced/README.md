# 0x16 - API advanced

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you're looking for
* How to use an API with pagination
* How to parse JSON results from an API
* How to make a recursive API call
* How to sort a dictionary by value
