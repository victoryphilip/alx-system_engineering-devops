# 0x14 - MySQL

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What is the main role of a database
* What is a database replica
* What is the purpose of a database replica
* Why database backups need to be stored in different physical locations
* What operation should you regularly perform to make sure that your database backup strategy actually works
